    	<p class="text_column">My work is focused on the p-side of linguistics. I am interested in what makes speakers have a tacit knowledge of wellfomedness of words, in other terms, a knowledge of possible and impossible words. In particular, I'm excited to know what's the nature and origin of this knowledge and how speakers learn it. I want to know if in their learning, they exhibit biases [substantive or other types] which goes against the ambient language and their linguistic experience. I have experience with experimental psycholinguistic methods and I am interested in exploring computational models to characterize phonotactic and phonological knowledge formally and mathematically. </p>

		  <strong> M.A Thesis: Learning Phonotactic Rules Sensitive to Sonority Sequencing Principle in Persian: Prior Bias or Experience?</strong> <br>
	    My thesis has focused on the SSP projection effects and learning phonotactics, using 2 acceptability judgment experiments with nonword stimuli. I wanted to know if Persian speakers exhibit any sensitivity to the SSP taking into account their linguistic experience with Persian phonotactic constraints with a CVC(C) syllable structure. Persian syllables have no attested onset clusters, and 21% of its attested coda clusters are against the SSP. The results confirmed the view that speakers can generalize their phonotactic knowledge beyond their lexicon and the fact that they exhibit some innate biases despite their lack of experience, aka the POS arguemnt.</p>

				This is a co-authored book chaprer titled: "Guttarals in Meymandi Dialect: a Case of Rule Interaction".<br>
				The interface between phonetics and phonology is one of the most intriguing aspects of
				linguistics. It has been proposed that phonology and phonetics can be treated as two distinct elements
				of one domain, where each element has an effect on the other to some degree. This study aims to focus
				on one sample of this interface in phonetics by analyzing the effects of gutturals in rule interactions in
				the phonology of the Meymandi dialect of Persian accompanied by acoustic analyses.

		  This is a project at IPA to translate the full IPA chart's metatext in different languages of the world. I'm voluntering to translate it to Persian. There's also an interactive chart project ongoing currently.
